%For each of these arguments, explain which rules of inference are used for each step.
%\begin{parts}
%    \part ``Linda, a student in this class, owns a red convertible.  Everyone who owns a red convertible has gotten at least one speeding ticket.  Therefore, someone in this class has gotten a speeding ticket."
%    \part ``Each of five roommates, Melissa, Aaron, Ralph, Veneesha, and Keeshawn, has taken a course in discrete mathematics.  Every student who has taken a course in discrete mathematics can take a course in algorithms.  Therefore, all five roommates can take a course in algorithms next year."

\question[8] Rosen Ch 1.6 \# 16(a,b), p. 79
%For each of these argument determine whether the argument is correct or incorrect and explain why.
%\begin{parts}
%    \part Everyone enrolled in the university has lived in a dormitory.  Mia has never lived in a dormitory.  Therefore, Mia is not enrolled in the university.
%    \part A convertible car is fun to drive.  Isaac's car is not a convertible. Therefore, Isaac's car is not fun to drive.
%    \part Quincy likes all action movies.  Quincy likes the movie \textit{Eight Men Out}.  Therefore \textit{Eight Men Out} is an action movie.
%    \part All lobstermen set at least a dozen traps.  Hamilton is a lobsterman. Therefore, Hamilton sets at least a dozen traps.

    \begin{my_item}
        \item[(a)] Correct, using universal instantiation and modus tollens.
        \item[(b)] Incorrect, after applying universal instantiation it uses the fallacy of denying the hypothesis.

\question[4] Rosen Ch 1.6 \# 18, p. 79
%What is wrong with this argument? Let $S(x,y)$ be ``$x$ is shorter than $y$." Given the premise $\exists s\; S(s, Max)$, it follows that $S(Max, Max)$.  Then by existential generalization it follows that $\exists x\; S(x,x)$, so that someone is shorter than himself.

    \begin{solution}
    It is true that there is some $s$ in the domain s.t. $S(s,Max)$; however, there is no guarantee that Max is the $s$.  This first step of the proof is invalid.
    \end{solution}


\question[4] Rosen Ch 1.6 \# 24, p. 79
%Identify the error or errors in this argument that supposedly shows that if $\forall x (P(x) \vee Q(x))$ is true then $\forall x P(x) \vee \forall x Q(x)$ is true.

%  & 2. P(c) \vee Q(c) \tag{Universal Inst. with (1)} \\
%  & 3. P(c) \tag{Simplification from (2) } \\
%  & 4. \forall x P(x) \tag{Univ. Gen. with (3)} \\
%  & 5. Q(c) \tag{Simplification from (2)} \\

%  & 7. \forall P(x) \vee \forall Q(x) \tag{Conjunction with (4) and (5)} \\
%\end{align*}

    \begin{solution}
    The incorrect steps are 3 and 5.  The simplification rule can not be applied to disjunctions.  Also, step 7 the conjunction rule should ``AND" terms together.

\question[10] Rosen Ch 1.7 \# 2, p. 91
%Use a direct proof to show that the sum of two even integers is even.

    \begin{solution}
    \textbf{Proof:} Assume you have two even integers $a$ and $b$.  By definition of even numbers, then there exists integers $k_a$ and $k_b$ such that $a=2k_a$ and $b=2k_b$.  Computer $a+b$:
    $$a+b = 2k_a + 2k_b = 2(k_a + k_b).$$
    The sum of the two even numbers is also in the form of a even number.
    Therefore, the sum of two even integers is even.
    \end{solution}


\question[10] Rosen Ch 1.7 \# 6, p. 91
% Use a direct proof to show that the product of two odd numbers is odd.
    \begin{solution}
    \textbf{Proof:} Assume there are two odd integers $a$ and $b$.  Then, by definition of odd there exists two integers $k_a$ and $k_b$ such that $a=2k_a + 1$ and $b=2k_b + 1$.  Compute $a \cdot b$:
    $$ a\cdot b = (2k_a + 1)\cdot(2k_b + 1) = 4k_ak_b + 2k_a + 2k_b + 1 = 2(2k_ak_b + k_a + k_b) + 1$$
    the product of the two odd integers is the form of an odd number. 
    Consequently, the product of two odd numbers is odd.
    \end{solution}


\uplevel{For the next two problems, you will use the definition of
$n$ being \textit{divisible} by $m$, specifically:

\smallskip
\textbf{Definition:} For natural numbers $n$ and $m$, then $n$ is
\underline{divisible} by $m$ if and only if there is a natural
number $k$ such that $n=km$.

\smallskip
For example, 56 is divisible by 8; there is a natural number $k$
(specifically, 7) such that $56 = 8k$. Also, thinking of the
bi-implication in the other direction, you can state because $39 = 3
\cdot 13$, 39 is divisible by 3 (or 39 is divisible by 13).}

\uplevel{An example of a proof using this new definition is to show,
\begin{center}
 "For all natural numbers $n$, if $n$ is divisible by 6, then $n^2$
 is divisible by 9."
\end{center}
Follow the examples in class,
\begin{quote}
Assume $n$ is divisible by 6.  Then, by definition of divisible
there is some natural number $k$ s.t. $n=6k$. Compute $n^2$:
\[ n^2 = (6k)^2 = 36k^2 = 9(4k^2). \]
where $n^2$ is divisible by 9 by definition. Therefore, for all
natural numbers, if $n$ is divisible by 6, then $n^2$ is divisible
by 9.
\end{quote}}

\question[10] Prove: For all natural numbers $n$, if $n$ is divisible by
12, then $n^2$ is divisible by 9.
    \begin{solution} \textbf{Proof:} Assume $n$ is divisible by 12.
    Then by definition of divisible there is some natural number $k$
    s.t. $n=12k$. Compute $n^2$:
    \[ n^2 = (12k)^2 = 144k^2 = 9(16k^2) \]
    It follows, $n^2$ is of the form of divisible by 9.  Therefore,
    for all natural numbers $n$, if $n$ is divisible by 12, then
    $n^2$ is divisible by 9.
    \end{solution}

\question[10] Prove divisibility is transitive, that is prove: If a is divisible by b and b is divisible by c then a is divisible by c.

    \begin{solution}
    \textbf{Proof:} Assume $a$ is divisible by $b$ and $b$ is divisible by $c$. By definition of divisibility, then there exists a natural number $k_a$ and $k_b$ such that $a = k_ab$ and $b = k_bc$.  The number a can be written as:
    $$ a = k_a b = k_a k_b c$$
    where $a$ is also divisible by $c$.  Therefore, if $a$ is divisible by $b$ and $b$ is divisible by $c$ then $a$ is divisible by $c$.
    \end{solution}
