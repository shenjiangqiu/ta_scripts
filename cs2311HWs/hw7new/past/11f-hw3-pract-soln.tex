%For each of these arguments, explain which rules of inference are used for each step.
%\begin{parts}
%    \part ``Linda, a student in this class, owns a red convertible.  Everyone who owns a red convertible has gotten at least one speeding ticket.  Therefore, someone in this class has gotten a speeding ticket."
%    \part ``Each of five roommates, Melissa, Aaron, Ralph, Veneesha, and Keeshawn, has taken a course in discrete mathematics.  Every student who has taken a course in discrete mathematics can take a course in algorithms.  Therefore, all five roommates can take a course in algorithms next year."

\question Rosen Ch 1.6 \# 16(c,d), p. 79
%For each of these argument determine whether the argument is correct or incorrect and explain why.
%\begin{parts}
%    \part Everyone enrolled in the university has lived in a dormitory.  Mia has never lived in a dormitory.  Therefore, Mia is not enrolled in the university.
%    \part A convertible car is fun to drive.  Isaac's car is not a convertible. Therefore, Isaac's car is not fun to drive.
%    \part Quincy likes all action movies.  Quincy likes the movie \textit{Eight Men Out}.  Therefore \textit{Eight Men Out} is an action movie.

\question Rosen Ch 1.6 \# 26, p. 80

    \begin{solution}
    This is to show that the conditional statement is true for all elements in the domain, that is $\forall x\; P(x) \ra R(x)$.  Show if $P(x)$ is true for a particular $x$ then $R(x)$ is also true.  For an item in the domain $x$, universal modus ponens with the first hypothesis gives $Q(x)$.  Then, apply universal modus ponens with the second hypothesis to get $R(x)$.

\question Give a direct proof that for all real numbers $x$ and $y$,
if $x$ and $y$ are rational, then $x-y$ is rational.
    \begin{solution}
    \textbf{Proof:} If $x$ and $y$ are rational, then there are
    integers $p, q\neq 0, r$, and $s\neq 0$ such that
    $x = \frac{p}{q}$ and $y = \frac{r}{s}$.  Then,
    \[ x - y = \frac{p}{q} - \frac{r}{s} = \frac{ps - qr}{qs} \]
    Since $ps - qr$ and $qs \neq 0$ are integers, it follows
    that $x - y$ is rational.  We have proved the difference of
    two rational numbers is rational.
    \end{solution}

\question For all natural numbers $n$, if $n$ is divisible by 5,
then $5n+5$ is divisible by 5.
    \begin{solution} \textbf{Proof:} Assume $n$ is divisible by 5.
    Then by definition of divisible there exists a natural number
    $k$ s.t. $n=5k$. Compute $5n+5$:
    \[ 5n + 5 = 5(5k) + 5 = 5(5k + 1) \]
    It follows that $5n+5$ is divisible by 5. Therefore, for all
    natural numbers $n$, if $n$ is divisible by 5, then $5n+5$ is
    divisible by 5.
    \end{solution}

%\question (similar to Rosen Ch 1.6, \# 28, p. 103) Prove that there
%are no integers $m$ and $n$ that satisfy the equation $2x^2 + 5y^2 =
%14$.
%    \begin{solution}
%    \textbf{Proof:} Since $x^2 = (-x)^2$, any positive value of
%    $x$ that is a solution also gives a negative value of $x$
%    that is a solution, so we only consider positive values of
%    $x$.  Similarly for $y$.  For $x >2$, $2x^2 > 14$, so we
%    need to only consider $x = 0$ or $x=1$ or $x=2$.  Similarly, when
%    $y > 1$, $5y^2 > 14$, so we need only to consider $y=0$ or $y=1$.
%    This leaves only twelve possible choices for $x$ and $y$
%    none of which satisfy the equation.
%    \end{solution}
